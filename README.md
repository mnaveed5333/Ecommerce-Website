Redesign the given React component for an e-commerce store interface in **light mode**, while keeping the overall structure, logical data, and links unchanged. Focus purely on updating the **visual design** to achieve a clean, professional, and modern light theme.

### Requirements:
1. **Theme & Styling**
   - Use Tailwind CSS with a light mode palette.
   - Apply soft shadows, rounded corners, and subtle hover effects.
   - Maintain good contrast and readability for text and icons.
   - Ensure proper spacing, padding, and alignment for a polished UI.

2. **Icons**
   - Replace all plain/simple icons with **React Icons** (import from `react-icons/fa`, `react-icons/fi`, or `react-icons/md`).
   - Use visually consistent icons for Wishlist, Cart, Profile, and Search.

3. **Animations**
   - Use **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions and hover animations.
   - Apply scale-up and fade-in effects on hover for buttons and icons.
   - Animate dropdown menus, side drawers, or modals (if present).
   - Use staggered animations for list/grid items (e.g., products).

4. **Responsiveness**
   - Ensure a **mobile-first design** that adapts seamlessly across all screen sizes.
   - Use a collapsible menu or drawer for smaller screens.
   - Maintain consistent spacing and grid layouts for tablet and desktop.

5. **Functional Expansion**
   - Add hover tooltips or labels for icons (e.g., "Wishlist", "Cart").
   - Include animated counters for Cart and Wishlist items.
   - Add a subtle animated background glow on active/focused states.
   - Create smooth dropdowns for user profile or categories (if applicable).

6. **Rules**
   - Do NOT change the **logical data, links, or structure**.
   - Only redesign **UI/UX** for aesthetics and modern usability.
   - Keep it clean, minimal, and professional.

### Deliverables:
- A **React component code** redesigned with Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and React Icons.
- Fully responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Light mode interface optimized for e-commerce.
